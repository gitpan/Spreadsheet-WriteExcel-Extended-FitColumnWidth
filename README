Spreadsheet-WriteExcel-Extended-FitColumnWidth

This module, as it's name indicates, extends Spreadsheet::WriteExcel
and excellent module by John McNamara (jmcnamara @ cpan.org) and where
possible utilises true type font metrics to determine what width a column
should be based on the data in it.

This is the first release and while it has been give some use before release
the testing has not been extensive.

In addition to providing auto column fit, there are other formatting features
included that I found useful.  I hope you do as well
